# Spartacus-Store

This project aims to clear



























### Lessons Learnt
- Supabase acts as your backend by handling the database and providing an API for your Angular frontend to fetch data (don't need to build in Node.js anymore)

Reason for creating separate service folder:
- Creates a reusable service to manage all interactions with Supabase (fetching products, users, etc.).
- Keeps API logic separate from the components, promoting clean and maintainable code.
